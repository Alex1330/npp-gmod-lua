#summary Instructions on various tasks dealing with this plugin
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= How to Install =
  * Download and install the latest version of Notepad++ at http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm
  * Unzip the GmodLua plugin.
  * Copy GmodLua.dll and the Config folder into your Notepad++/plugins folder.

= How to Change the Style and Color of Keywords =
  * In Notepad++, go to Settings > Style Configurator...
  * Under Language scroll down to "Gmod 10 Lua," usually at the bottom.
  * You are able to change the look and feel of each different style category here as well as define custom keywords and user extensions (.lua is default)
  * The "Global Styles" in the language box also allows for other types of style configurations.

= How to Edit Keywords Manually =
  * Open GmodLua.xml which is in Notepad++/plugins/Config
  * For each "Keywords" line, you can put as many keywords as you want.
  * The name must be a number between 0 and 8.
  * The number must correspond to a "keywordClass" in a "WordsStyle" tag.
  * In the "WordStyle" you can set the names to anything you'd like, but the styleID needs to be 20 + the value of the keywordClass.

= How to Edit Keywords Automatically =
  * Move Npp_Keywords.lua from the GmodLua zip file into garrysmod/lua and once in game run the following command.

  _lua_openscript Npp_Keywords.lua; lua_openscript_cl Npp_Keywords.lua_

  * Copy and paste the contents of garrysmod/data/gmod_lua.txt into Notepad++/plugins/Config/GmodLua.xml, between the <Language></Language> tag. (Don't overwrite the comments, of course.)
  * Be aware that any global functions or variables declared by other mods will be added to the keyword list.

= How to Compile from Source =
  * Compile the latest version of Notepad++ with Visual Studios [http://notepad-plus.wiki.sourceforge.net/Build+Notepad+plus+plus+and+NppInsertPlugin+with+VC+studio+2005+or+2008+Express using this tutorial].
  * Download a Subversion (SVN) program. I prefer [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortoiseSVN] but there are [http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients other good ones available].
  * Checkout the module you want by issuing the checkout command on [http://npp-gmod-lua.googlecode.com/svn/<replace_with_module_name>/].
  * Module names: GmodLua, GmodLuaLite, GmodLuaUnopt
  * Move the resulting local directory into the npp.<version>.src directory so that the GmodLua folder is sitting alongside the PowerEditor and scintilla folders.
  * Add the .vcproj file to the Visual Studios solution used to compile Notepad++ and then recompile.
  * Look in the GmodLua source's bin folder and take the dll and the Config folder and drop it in Notepad++'s plugins folder.
